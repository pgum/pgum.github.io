# Empirism and experiment

* Rational decision making process
* Elements of experiment
* Guideline to meaningful results

![bg left:33%][experiment]
<!-- Additional information
Objective:
    * rational decision-making should be based upon gathered data
    * experiments need: sponsor, group in charge, plan, definition of done, timebox
    * think and measure only what is important, adapt
Agenda:
    * aligned view on how do we make decisions
    * elements of experiment process
    * defining roles of sponsor and group in charge - purpose and responsibilities
    * defining plan - scope, DoD and timebox - 
    * analyze results: not only bussiness, also method and KPIs involved
    * if you don't measure it its not important for you

## Elements of experiment

* Sponsor
* Well-defined goal
* Transparent procedure
* Feedback loop

<!-- Additional information 
* Scientists - interested in results
* Thesis - defined goals
* Procedure
  + Record state before experiment
  + Making the actual change in the system
  + Record state after experiment
  + Analyze data
* Document and share results - look for feedback
* Inspect and Adapt experiment framework

## Sponsor and group in charge

* Sponsor - Strongly interested person
* Group in charge - appropriate group of people with
  * all required skills
  * access to resources
  * spare time

## Smart goals and KPI

### What is the purpose of setting KPI

<!-- Additional information 
    * What is the connection between goals and KPI?
    * Do we observe alignment between measurements and goals declared in our organization?
    * KPI is M (measurable) in SMART

## Key Performance Indicator

* Not **every** indicator
* Tells about actual **performance**
* **Indicator** doesn't tell full story - ask for details
* Checked on regular basis

<!-- Additional information 
    * We choose only few key qualities we focus on so we can agree on meaning and importance of chosen qualities to measure.
    * We must have believe we measure performance
      * How well are chosen qualities tell about performing on the job - adding value to product?
      * What change we would hope to observe if this KPI would get better by 35%?
      * What timeframe is suitable to capture results of given KPI?
    * Remeber "indicator" is not a "full score". To fully understand KPI value ask questions and clarify
      * What are some indicators that don't need clarifying and are ok on their own (without any asking for story)?
      * Problems risen with telling a story makes optimization easier
    * If KPI is setted up but left uncheck for longer time - ask why is that
      * Does that KPI really capture the essence of quality we want to measure?
      * Why is it not checked regularly? 
      * What do we do with "stray" KPI?
