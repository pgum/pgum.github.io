# Constructing a template

* Gather data
* Generalize
* Be specific
* Let it live

Note: 

* Gathering data as a part of empirical process is a must to be able to reason about the process.
* Observations should be analized to find common themes from gathered data. Choose those which would benefit the most from having more standarized process.
* Be specific about the purpose and goals of the template. 
  * Who will benefit from using it?
  * What changes would need to happen for it to succede?
* Share template, ask for feedback, change it. 
  * Encourage people to use it. 
  * When to enforce template on people?
  * Observe changes made
  * Adapt in new version in new iteration
  * Record and share template and observations

# Template pitfall #1

## Set in stone

Note:  

Templating is a process not an one-time thing
Establish feedback loop and decide on evaluation period
Always remember what you measure and for what ends
Don't be scared to experiment

# Template pitfall #2

## "Nah, I don't use it"

Note:  

Encouragement to keep up discipline in applying developed template should come from following sources:

* agreeing with identified goal (shared goal)
* understanding the need of template in given field (shared idea)
* was part of working group that created it (shared work, relevancy)

Enforcement means external pressure, while encouragement is more like enabling inner motivation to action.

What problems do we encunter?

# Template pitfall #3

## It's a bother and not an aid

Note: 

Is it relevant in our current workflow?
Do all groups of interest agree that template is useful?
What is valuable, what was the goal of it? What are main bothers?
How can we keep valuable ideas while optmizing the template?
