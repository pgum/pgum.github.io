# Downtime

1. Defects
2. Overproduction
3. Waiting
4. Non-Unused talent
5. Transportation
6. Inventory
7. Motion
8. Extra-processing

Note:

Defects: 
    * wrong priorities
    * customer defects
    * not compliant with documentation/manual

Overproduction: 
    * too many corner case
    * manual work instead of automation
    * too detailed documentation

Waiting: 
    * Sign of approval between "phases"
    * External dependencies
    * Decision-making meetings without action points

Non-Unused talent: 
    * Knowledge sharing
    * Rigid division of roles in team
    * Improvement forum

Transportation: 
    * Continous Integration and repository
    * Build time
    * Time, budget, work in-between demo/customer feedback

Motion: 
    * Office space
    * Access to information
    * Colocation of team
    * All roles needed to complete project in team

Extra-processing:
    * Unused artifacts (ie. build compiled on obsolete platform)
    * Wrong (irrelevant) KPI
    * Ineffective toolset

# How do we measure waste?

Note:

* How do we know what is important?
* Do we understand reason between KPI we use?
* Do they measure what is important to us?

# How to measure
- Value Stream Mapping
- Spaghetti diagram
- Email chain length
- Critical Path
- Daily stand-up, Retrospection
- RCA

Note:

* Which of these do we implement?
* Do any of these have disadventages? What?
* What else could we use to measure?
