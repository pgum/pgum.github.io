## Description
Word *measure* can be substituted with: **notice**, **speak about**, **rise up**, *etc*.
Without benchmarking there is no possible way to make rational decision.
If problems aren't noticed, or spoken about there is no way to react.

## Purpose
* Small set of well-defined KPI that shows state of thing we care about. 
* Culture of open comunication, asking and taking actions

## Examples
* Action Items on decision making meetings
* Frequency of using formal and informal means of giving feedback among peers

## Checklist
* We know our KPI well and agree all of them make sense and measure essence of our work
* We have adequate control over measured process to be hold responsible for all KPIs 
* We keep living board of things to do like we do, and things we notice we could do better
* We are able to speak freely about identified risks and impediments
* We give each other feedback frequently
* We don't have problem to assign AI within a team
* We know our build/deploy time
* We are aware of critical path in our process
