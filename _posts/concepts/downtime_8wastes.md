# 8 wastes od manufacturing - DOWNTIME
## Downtime is the consequence of waste
Its also acronym for 8 types of waste as defined by lean management.
In IT some kinds of waste is hard to observe and measure as we don't produce physical objects.

## Defects: 
### How many times client says "It's not working" or "It's not what I payed for"  
* wrong priorities
* customer defects
* not compliant with documentation/manual
### Follow-up questions
* How do we identify and minimize defects in our products?
* How often do we get feedback from the client?
* Do we offer clients our feedback?
* What is the quality and relevance of gathered data?
* What new qualities did we introduced after feedback from the client recently?

## Overproduction: 
### Doing too much, or ineffective work, lagging out delivery
* too many corner case
* manual work instead of automation
* too detailed documentation
### Follow-up questions
* What is our delivery chain process?
* Do we understand and accept each step - what value does it bring to the product?
* What is our critical path?
* What would need to happen to make whole process faster?

## Waiting: 
### We try to multitask to avoid losing time, so we lose time on context switching later
* Sign of approval between "phases"
* External dependencies
* Decision-making meetings without action points
### Follow-up questions
* In what ways do we collaborate in production process between teams?
* To what extent I can make relevant decisions for myself?
* What communication medium do we use?

## Non-Unused talent: 
* Knowledge sharing
* Rigid division of roles in team
* Improvement forum

## Transportation: 
* Continous Integration and repository
* Build time
* Time, budget, work in-between demo/customer feedback

## Motion: 
* Office space
* Access to information
* Colocation of team
* All roles needed to complete project in team

## Extra-processing:
* Unused artifacts (ie. build compiled on obsolete platform)
* Wrong (irrelevant) KPI
* Ineffective toolset
