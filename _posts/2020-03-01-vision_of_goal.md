## Scenario description


![visualization of ideal state][capturing-the-sun]

### 5 mins - Set the stage - Explain meeting goals to the Team 
  - Let's hold on for a second and think about how our would would look like in its ideal state.
  - Use flipchart to draw imaginary path to excellence symbolized by literal path toward Sun on top 
### 5 mins - Idea generation 
  - on post-it write your wishes, as specific as possible, how would you like for your work to be like 
  - when finished team stick their ideas to flipchart
### 20 mins - Defining Improvement Backlog 
  * sort and possibly group results into categories
  * first priority evaluation - sort by count of duplicated ideas
  * for each idea generated - evaluation #1:
    * What is the common understanding of the idea? All agree?
    * What value would that bring us? (Low, Medium, High)
    * Sort on flipchart - most valuable near bottom, less urgent higher near sun
  * What new ideas came during discussion? Write them down too!
### 20 min - Backlog refinement
  * analyze first 2 or 3 ideas, starting from most valuable 
    * What is current situation that hold us back from ideal state?
    * What improvement actions can we try to get closet to ideal state?
    * What would be first three steps to make that change happen? 
  * Categorize effort needed to implement discussed actions - Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large
    * General rule-of-thumb would be small is something we could change with good discipline and plan in few months, large would we something that either needs a lot more time or requires to convince other people to participate or is complicated
  * For small actions with medium or high value assign responsible person - these are low-hanging fruits - assign shorter timebox to them
  * For each of remaining actions (medium, large, extra large):
    - define responsible person from the Team that shall "make working group" 
    - be point of contact and "most interested person" on given action
    - set deadline for making follow-up meeting, gathering neccessary participants to refine idea on broader forum
  * Don't overburden whole team with actions or working groups
### 10 mins - Define Review Date and next steps
  * Define one plane to store actions and their status in transparent way
  * Define follow-up meeting for Backlog refinement
  * Gather feedback on methodology used
