* After half time one can change with person from outer circle
For participants as observators:
* Don't engage in discussion until let in inner circle
* Write out ideas, actions, or key points, etc. and gather on flipchart

### 15 mins - Reflect on discussion

Group and sort notes from both groups, prioritize. For new, briefly discuss:

* What difference would that make
* Do we have list of risks
* What are the trade-offs to take account for
* Is there underlying proccess to uncover

### 15 mins - Discussion - part II

Mix up participants. Part II is more for in-depth discussion about key chosen points only, focus.  
For each key-point change set for inner circle.
For participants in inner circle:

* What are short term costs
* What are long term gains
* Is it worth it
* How much is it aligned with our values
* What would be the costs/consequences
* What are the risks
* What can we learn from that
For all - decide on most decent solution/action from defined pool  

### 5 mins - Closing

Assure that group understands made decisions, actions taken are smart, and are not overkill for the participants to do.
