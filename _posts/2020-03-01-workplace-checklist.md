## Workplace checklist

### Description

Making workplace better is a never ending process. Having a checklist of different  practices and behaviors to take notice of eases the task by providing a starting point in `inspect` phase of `inspect&adapt` cycle.

It's not a complete list, but it's a start. It's beneficial to create such list as a team- or company-wide activity to start a conversation about workplace. Like everything, it has to be adapted to your needs and situation. Some businesses may not have a need for some items, others may have a need for more.
