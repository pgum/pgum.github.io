# Planning and refinement
+ Backlog is not WBS 
+ What can we plan
+ Just barely good enough
+ Planning is a process
![bg left:33%][horizon]
Note:
Objective:
    * Being agile means we can fiddle with costs, content or deadline when agreed with the client
    * Backlog is fine-grained only on the top to avoid waste of replanning and no-work
    * Responding to client needs faster generates more revenue 
Agenda:
    * Only change is constant
    * Periodic inspect & adapt loop for value we deliver is critical
    * It's always a trade-off
    * Don't put up unnecessary work
