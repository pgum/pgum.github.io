# How do we measure waste?

Note:
* How do we know what is important?
* Do we understand reason between KPI we use?
* Do they measure what is important to us?

# How to measure
- Value Stream Mapping
- Spaghetti diagram
- Email chain length
- Critical Path
- Daily stand-up, Retrospection
- RCA
Note:
* Which of these do we implement?
* Do any of these have disadventages? What?
* What else could we use to measure?
